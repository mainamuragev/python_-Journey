 Focus of This Repo
- Understanding how variables work in Python
- Practicing naming conventions for clarity and consistency
- Building fluency in assigning, updating, and printing variables
- Exploring best practices for readable and maintainable code

What I Learned
- How to declare and assign variables (x = 5, name = "Maina")
- The difference between snake_case, camelCase, and PascalCase
- Why meaningful variable names improve code readability
- How to use print() to display variable values and debug logic


 Tools Used
- Python 3.x
- VS Code / Geany / Cmder for editing and running scripts
- Git & GitHub for version control and public documentation

Why It Matters
This repo is part of a larger effort to build technical fluency and share my learning journey as I pivot into software and data engineering. By documenting even the basics, I aim to support others starting out and create a strong foundation for more advanced projects.
